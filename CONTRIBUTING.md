# Contributing Guidelines

Gosh, as an experiment, uses the [C4 process](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/).
Please do take the time to read it.

If you feel like it is too heavyweight and you rather not contribute at all than use it,
please at least follow those 2 basic rules:

1. Always create an issue first. Always communicate before writing code.
2. Please use the suggested commit message format and pull request body format.
   That allows us to use them in the CHANGELOG.md without changes.
